NOTE: If you are running on mcore48, the following is **NOT** necessary.

Begin by placing in your home directory a file named .mpd.conf
    (/etc/mpd.conf if root), containing the line 

    secretword=<secretword>

    where <secretword> is a string known only to yourself.  It should
    NOT be your normal Unix password.  Make this file readable and
    writable only by you:

      chmod 600 .mpd.conf

Then, at the command line, execute:
$mpd&
